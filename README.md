The Defenestration of Prague (1618)

In this bizarre and pivotal moment in European history, a group of Protestant nobles threw two Catholic officials out of a third-story window of Prague Castle. Remarkably, the officials survivedâ€”allegedly by landing in a pile of manure. This act of defiance helped spark the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive conflicts in European history.# New-Test
